##You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. The keys in student_scores are the names 
#of the students and the values are their exam scores.

#Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your program, you should have a 
#new dictionary called student_grades that should contain student names for keys and their grades for values.
# The final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked.
